"Time, he learned, was not to be measured in hours or minutes, or even seconds. Time was measured in moments. The time keeper didnâ€™t just count the seconds, he understood their significance, how each moment could shape a life, a destiny."

"the true beauty of time lies in its impermanence"

Albom, Mitch. The Time Keeper. New York: Hyperion, 2012.
